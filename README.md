# Emergency Aid Management System

## Project Overview

The **Emergency Aid Management System** simulates an assembly line with any number of stations. Each station handles a specific item, and customer orders are processed through the stations to fill requests based on inventory. The system allows tracking of inventory, managing orders, and handling supplies.

The project is divided into three milestones to guide implementation, debugging, and execution. The assembly line simulation involves:

1. **Milestone 1**: Implementation of `Utilities` and `Station` classes.
2. **Milestone 2**: Implementation of the `CustomerOrder` module.
3. **Milestone 3**: Implementation of `Workstation` and `LineManager` modules.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **Utilities Module**: Supports parsing input files for setup and configuration.
- **Station Module**: Manages information about a station and handles inventory.
- **CustomerOrder Module**: Processes customer orders and tracks item fulfillment.
- **Workstation Module**: Manages order processing and inventory at individual stations.
- **LineManager Module**: Configures the assembly line and manages order movement across stations.



## Milestones

### Milestone 1

- **Utilities Module**: Implements functionality for parsing input files and extracting tokens.
- **Station Module**: Manages a single station on the assembly line, including stock and order handling.

### Milestone 2

- **CustomerOrder Module**: Manages customer orders, processes item requests, and handles order fulfillment.

### Milestone 3

- **Workstation Module**: Manages order processing at individual stations and handles inventory.
- **LineManager Module**: Configures the assembly line, manages stations, and processes customer orders through the line.
